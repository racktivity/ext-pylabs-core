#Scheduling Actions
In many cases it is desirable that certain actions are executed on a regular basis. In such a situation you can create scheduled actions.
A scheduled action can launch event-driven actions; for example check a mailbox every five minutes, where an event can be thrown when mails have arrived.


##Creating a Scheduled Action
Similar to all other actions of a PyApp, sheduled actions too are tasklets. A scheduled action however has a specific `match` function, which defines the execution interval of the action. The tasklet is located in `<pyapp name>/impl/schedule/config/<config app>/`. See the [PyApps Directory Structure](sampleapp) for more information about the location of the files.


##Defining the Interval
In the `match` function you must import the standard Python `time` library. The `params` dictionary, which is used throughout the complete PyLabs framework, keeps track of the execution time of a tasklet with the key `taskletexecutiontime`. This allows us to set the interval for the tasklet.

    def match(q, i, params, tags):
        import time
        return (params['taskletlastexecutiontime']  + 300 >= time.time())

The example above shows us that the tasklet is executed when the interval is more than 300 seconds.
