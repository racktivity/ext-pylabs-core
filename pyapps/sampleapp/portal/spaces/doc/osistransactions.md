#OSIS Transactions
In the previous section you have learned how you can create OSIS views and that the views, with their objects, are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
In this section we will cover how you can store, update, and delete objects from these views.


##Creating an OSIS Transaction
An OSIS transaction is a [tasklet](http://confluence.incubaid.com/display/PYLABS/Tasklets) which is stored in the directory `<pyapp name>/impl/osis/<domain>/<root object>`. See the [PyApps Directory Structure](/sampleapp/#/doc/sampleapp) for more information about the location of the files.

Each file has the following identification:

* __author__ : name of the author of the tasklet
* __tags__ : set of tasklet identifications, used by the tasklet engine to retrieve the proper tasklet
* __priority__ : priority of the tasklet, the lower the value, the lower the priority


##Creating an OSIS Store and Update Transaction
The store and update transaction in an OSIS view are identical. The main flow is:

1. Create an OSIS connection
2. Get the Root Object from the params, offered to the tasklet
3. Set the values of the Root Object properties
4. Save the OSIS view


###Import Libraries
A first thing to add to the OSIS view is the import of the `OsisDB` library:

    from osis.store.OsisDB import OsisDB

Import other libraries if necessary but that is not likely.

Typically we also define some global variable, such as the domain, the Root Object, and the corresponding OSIS view.

    ROOTOBJECT_TYPE = 'sampleapprootobject'
    DOMAIN = "sampleappdomain"
    VIEW_NAME = '%s_view_%s_list' % (DOMAIN, ROOTOBJECT_TYPE)


###Connecting to OSIS
In the `main` function of the tasklet you have to create a connection to OSIS. The function uses five arguments: q, i, p, params, and tags. `p` represents the PyApp name space and `params` is a dictionary filled by the PyLabs framework. 

    def main(q, i, p, params, tags):
        osis = OsisDB.getConnection(p.api.appname)


###Storing or Updating the Root Object in an OSIS View
A first step to store or update a Root Object is to get the Root Object from the `params` dictionary:

    rootobject = params['rootobject']

When you have the Root Object, you can set the different values of the Root Object properties.

    values = {
        'property1': rootobject.property1
        'property2': rootobject.property2,
        'property3': rootobject.property3,
        'property4': rootobject.property4
        }

The properties of the Root Object are all defined in the [Root Object Model](/sampleapp/#/doc/modeling).

When you have set the values of the Root Object, you only have to save the view with the new or updated Root Object. This action is a method on the osis connection and expects the following arguments in the given order:

* domain to which the view belongs
* the name of Root Object
* name of the osis view
* guid of the Root Object
* version of the Root Object
* a dictionary with values

    osis.viewSave(DOMAIN, ROOTOBJECT\_TYPE, VIEW\_NAME, rootobject.guid, rootobject.version, values)


###Execution Tasklet
The store and update tasklet can only be executed when the `rootobjecttype` in the `params` dict matches the given Root Object type. Thus this must be defined in the match function of the tasklet:

    def match(q, i, params, tags):
        return params['rootobjecttype'] == ROOTOBJECT_TYPE


##Example of an OSIS Store
    
    __author__ = 'Incubaid'
    __tags__ = 'osis', 'store'
    __priority__= 1

    from osis.store.OsisDB import OsisDB

    ROOTOBJECT_TYPE = 'sampleapprootobject'
    DOMAIN = "sampleappdomain"
    VIEW_NAME = '%s_view_%s_list' % (DOMAIN, ROOTOBJECT_TYPE)

    def main(q, i, p, params, tags):
        osis = OsisDB.getConnection(p.api.appname)

        rootobject = params['rootobject']

        values = {
            'property1': rootobject.property1
            'property2': rootobject.property2,
            'property3': rootobject.property3,
            'property4': rootobject.property4
            }

        osis.viewSave(DOMAIN, ROOTOBJECT_TYPE, VIEW_NAME, rootobject.guid, rootobject.version, values)

    def match(q, i, params, tags):
        return params['rootobjecttype'] == ROOTOBJECT_TYPE


##Creating an OSIS Delete Transaction
The flow of a delete transaction in an OSIS view is similar to the create/update transaction flow. First create a connection to OSIS, get Root Object data, and finally update the OSIS view by deleting the Root Object.


###Retrieving the Root Object Data
To delete a Root Object from an OSIS view, you need its guid and version. These data are all stored in the `params` dict and can be retrieved as follows:

    rootobjectguid = params['rootobjectguid']
    rootobjectversionguid = params['rootobjectversionguid']

To delete the object, you must use the `viewDelete` method on the the OSIS connection object. This method expects the following arguments in the given order:

* domain to which the view belongs
* the name of Root Object
* name of the osis view
* guid of the Root Object
* version of the Root Object

    osis.viewSave(DOMAIN, ROOTOBJECT\_TYPE, VIEW\_NAME, rootobjectguid, rootobjectversionguid)


###Execution Tasklet
The store and update tasklet can only be executed when the `rootobjecttype` in the `params` dict matches the given Root Object type. Thus this must be defined in the match function of the tasklet:

    def match(q, i, params, tags):
        return params['rootobjecttype'] == ROOTOBJECT_TYPE


##Example of an OSIS Delete

    __author__ = 'Incubaid'
    __tags__ = 'osis', 'delete'
    __priority__= 3

    from osis.store.OsisDB import OsisDB

    ROOTOBJECT_TYPE = 'lead'
    DOMAIN = "crm"
    VIEW_NAME = '%s_view_%s_list' % (DOMAIN, ROOTOBJECT_TYPE)

    def main(q, i, p, params, tags):
        osis = OsisDB().getConnection(p.api.appname)

        rootobjectguid = params['rootobjectguid']
        rootobjectversionguid = params['rootobjectversionguid']

        osis.viewDelete(DOMAIN, ROOTOBJECT_TYPE, VIEW_NAME, rootobjectguid, rootobjectversionguid)

    def match(q, i, params, tags):
        return params['rootobjecttype'] == ROOTOBJECT_TYPE


##What's Next?
So far you have learned about: 

* modeling Root Objects and its interfaces
* the creation of OSIS views and their purposes
* the creation of OSIS transactions

In a next step we will discuss how you can create your own forms and wizards of your PyApp. A form and a wizard are both UI elements of your PyApp.
