    3- chart_data:- A list of the bubble set(s) that will be drawn where each bubble set is a list of  
       points.The points must be a list of [x, y, z, 'value'] as x, y are the axes of the point, z is  
       the diameter of the bubble and 'value' is what is written in the bubble. A mandatory parameter.  
    4- chart_div:- The HTML div that will contain the chart. A mandatory parameter.

          [1.3, 2, 17, "VW"], [1.2, 1.2, 13, "Mini"]]],

         "renderer" :"$.jqplot.BubbleRenderer"
        }
