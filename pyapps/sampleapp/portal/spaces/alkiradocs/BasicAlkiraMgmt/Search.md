#Searching in Alkira
The Alkira platform gives you three possibilities to look up information. You have these three search fields at your disposal:

* Title
* Labels
* Search

In this section we discuss how to use the three different search options.


###Title
By entering data in the `Title` box, Alkira looks up for matching page titles in its database. Matching pages are displayed as you type, which make it very user-friendly, because only exact matches return a result.

For example, searching for 'Home' will take you to the home page of the `alkiradocs` space because it matches to the page named `Home.md`. If you would search in the Title field for `Hom`, an error is displayed that the page could not be found.


###Labels
You can also search using tags and labels. Currently, when a page is created, we give it a default tag that is `space:space_name`; where `space_name` is the name of the space that the page belongs to.

For example, since all our pages belong to the 'alkiradocs' space, searching for `alkiradocs` returns all the pages in that space since they were all assigned that tag during creation.

__Note:__ The `Label` search field is comma separated, which means you can search for several tags and labels at the same time in order to narrow down your search results.


###Search

The `Search` field is a search field as any other search; whatever you write will be searched for in all the pages in the space. For example, if you search for the word 'create', all the pages that contain that word are displayed.
