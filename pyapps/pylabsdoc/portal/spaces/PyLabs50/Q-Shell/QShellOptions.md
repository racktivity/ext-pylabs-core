## Other Q-Shell Options

Besides the debug mode of Q-Shell, you can start Q-Shell with other options:

    -h or --help: show the help function. You see the different options for the Q-Shell.
    -d or --debug: run the Q-Shell in debug mode for additional information in case an error occurs.
    -n or --no-default-initialization: do not perform the default initialization when starting the Q-Shell.
    -f FILENAME or -file=FILENAME: execute a file
    -l or -logserver: start the logserver. A second Q-Shell must be started for working with the Q-Shell.
                      In the log server window, you find all logging of the actions that you perform in the Q-Shell.
                      This option is useful for advanced troubleshooting.
