## Introducing Q-Packages

Q-Packages is Incubaid's platform independent software and content distribution system. It is similar to conventional package systems ([deb][], [rpm][], [yum][], ...), but without their complexity.

A Q-Package is a package to be installed in PyLabs 5. A software package can be self-created software, as well as open-source packages, for example [nginx][] or [PostgreSQL][]. But a package can not only be software, but also a virtual machine image or documentation. 

The Q-Package framework is part of the PyLabs 5 framework. By using PyLabs it becomes easy to create you own packages. You no longer need to be a developer to create packages. 

Whatever you need to distribute in PyLabs 5, Q-Package is your friend.
