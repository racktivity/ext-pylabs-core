[te]: @todo insert link to tasklet engine

## Tasklets

Tasklets are small pieces of code that are executed by a [PyLabs Tasklet Engine][te]. Tasklets can be called by other tasklets but they can also be triggered by events or specific criteria.
Tasklets are used over the full PyLabs framework stack, from displaying wizards to storing object in a database.
