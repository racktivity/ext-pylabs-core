## PyLabs Applications

A PyLabs Application (PyApp) is an application that is developed on the PyLabs framework and therefore must run on this framework. Each PyApp has the same specific architecture.
A PyApp consists of a set of [Root Objects][ro], a logical unit in your application, and each Root Object has its proper set of functions. This is basic idea behind PyApps.

A PyApp is built in such a way that it can be easily modified or extended, without worrying about breaking existing functionalities. 
PyApps can use the full potential of PyLabs, such as its event and logging mechanism. This means that you can totally focus on the functionality of your application.
