# Introducing Pylabs 5
Want to automate your system administration in an easy way?
Tired of spending hours in writing scripts and some more hours to debug your script because it's not working as expected?
Always dreamed of creating applications in a couple of hours?

Then Pylabs is your salvation. 
Pylabs is a framework with two main objectives, enabling easy datacenter automation and being a platform for rapid application development.


## Datacenter Automation
In a datacenter, the purchase of hardware is a huge cost, but maintaining your hardware is an equally large cost. Not only because of hardware failures, but also the number of human interventions to keep your datacenter up and running.
Pylabs is a platform that offers you the possibility to reduce the human interventions significantly. Therefore Pylabs has a new scripting language, based on [Python 2.6][pyton]. Besides the Python functionalities and libraries, Pylabs offers extra libraries that can interact with your hardware as well as with the operating systems in your datacenter.

Build your own scripts with Pylabs' [Q-Shell][qshell] and no longer waste money in time consuming interventions.


## Rapid Application Development
When you go one step beyond writing scripts, you come to developing applications. An application that runs on the Pylabs framework is called a PyApp. 

A PyApp is built in such a way that you can create it in no time and that it is very easy to extend your application. A PyApp not necessarily has to be datacenter automation related, you can create any  application that you want, from basic to really advanced applications.


## Why Using the Pylabs Framework?
Pylabs is the ideal framework for datacenter automation, thanks to the integrated System Abstraction Layer (SAL), the built-in Q-Shell, its easy package management, and many other features.

Just like Pylabs itself is a breeze to install, it is amazingly easy to install other Pylabs packages. No special pre-installation preparations, no longer check if your system can run a package, just install the package that you want.

With the introduction of the Pylabs scripting language, you develop in a uniform way your scripts as well as the code for you PyApps. The learning curve is so low that you start with simple scripts but end with really advanced ones in not time.
If Pylabs doesn't offer you the functionality that you need, you can easily add your own functions to the framework.

Each PyApp has the same architecture, which make it easy to create your own PyApp. With this uniform way of developing PyApps, you no longer waste time in examining an application before you can alter, extend, or correct PyApps.
Your PyApps can make use of the Pylabs event and logging systems. You don't have to set up your own systems, everything is ready to be used inside the Pylabs framework.


## About this Book
This book covers all facets of the Pylabs framework, from the Pylabs architecture over creating scripts (Datacenter Automation) to creating Pylabs Applications.

The intended audience for this book are system administrators and developers. Python knowledge is an asset but definitely not required to use this book.
