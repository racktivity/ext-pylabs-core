#OSIS Views
As explained in the [PyApp architecture][architecture], OSIS stands for Object Store and Indexing System. OSIS is responsible for populating the [Arakoon][arakoon] object store as well as a PostgreSQL database.
In this section we will discuss the PostgreSQL connection, which is responsible to store views on objects.

Since the Arakoon object store can not be queried, the retrieval of object would be too slow and thus not user-friendly. That's where the PostgreSQL database comes into play.
The PostgreSQL database is used to store different views on Root Objects. A view is a definition of what you want to see of a Root Object. This means that you can create multiple views on one Root Object. For example on a Root Object "Customer" you can create a view which contains only the name and guid of the customer, but another view can contain name, customer ID, postal code, and city. You have to find a good balance in the number of views that you create and the clarity of the views. Too many views make easily a mishmash of your directory, too little views make some operations less effective.


##Creating an OSIS View
An OSIS view is a [tasklet][] which is stored in the directory `<pyapp name>/impl/setup/osis`. See the [PyApps Directory Structure][pyappdir] for more information about the location of the files.


###Import Libraries
A first thing to add to the OSIS view is the import of the `OsisDB` library:

[[code]]
from osis.store.OsisDB import OsisDB
[[/code]]

Import other libraries if necessary but that is not likely.


###Creating the View Name
A name for an OSIS view must be concise, but clear too. Therefore, we use at least the domain name and the root object name as name for the view.

[[code]]
def main(q, i, params, tags):
    domain = 'mydomain'
    rootobject = 'myrootobject'
    appname = params['appname']
    view_name = '%s_view_%s_list' %(domain, rootobject)
[[/code]]    

Note that all variable names can be changed into names of your own choice.
For the `view_name` variable, it is highly recommended to use the domain and root object name in the name of your view list, and to optionally add some more specification to the name.


###Creating the OSIS View
To create an OSIS view, you need to connect to the OSIS database. Also verify if the view_name does not yet exist for the given domain and root object.

[[code]]
connection = OsisDB().getConnection(appname)
if not connection.viewExists(domain, rootobject, view_name):
    ...
[[/code]]    

Once you have your OSIS connection, it takes you three steps to create the view:

1. Create a view-object, which is comparable with a table
2. Add the desired data to the view-object
3. Add the view to OSIS

Example:

[[code]]
#create view object:
    view = connection.viewCreate(domain, rootobject, view_name)
#add desired data
    view.setCol('name', q.enumerators.OsisType.STRING, True)
    view.setCol('code', q.enumerators.OsisType.STRING, True)
    view.setCol('customerguid', q.enumerators.OsisType.UUID, True)
    view.setCol('source', q.enumerators.OsisType.STRING, True)

    ...

#add view to OSIS
    connection.viewAdd(view)
[[/code]]    

The `setCol`-method of the view object expects three arguments:

* name of a root object property, as defined in the [Root Object Model][model]
* type of the property, which must be an OSIS-type
* boolean to indicate if the value may be null (True) or not (False)


###Adding Indexes
To optimize the OSIS views, you can add indexes on your view. The index is a data structure that improves the speed and lowers the workload of the database server upon data retrieval operations in OSIS. 
However, this optimization has also some drawbacks. Index usage takes up quite a bit of disk space, and more importantly, too many indexes may result in a slow database.

In short, indexes speed up data retrieval but slows down data manipulation (writing, deleting, updating) which means that you have to find a good balance in the number of indexes that you want to use.

To add indexes to an OSIS view:

[[code]]
indexes = ['name', 'customerguid']
for field in indexes:
    context = {'schema': "%s_%s" % (domain, rootobject), 'view': view_name, 'field': field}
    connection.runQuery("CREATE INDEX %(field)s_%(schema)s_%(view)s ON %(schema)s.%(view)s (%(field)s)" % context)
[[/code]]


##Example of a Complete OSIS View
[[code]]
from osis.store.OsisDB import OsisDB

def main(q, i, params, tags):
    domain = 'mydomain'
    rootobject = 'myrootobject'
    appname = params['appname']
    view_name = '%s_view_%s_list' %(domain, rootobject)
    
    connection = OsisDB().getConnection(appname)
    if not connection.viewExists(domain, rootobject, view_name):
        view = connection.viewCreate(domain, rootobject, view_name)
        view.setCol('name', q.enumerators.OsisType.STRING, True)
        view.setCol('code', q.enumerators.OsisType.STRING, True)
        view.setCol('customerguid', q.enumerators.OsisType.UUID, True)
        view.setCol('source', q.enumerators.OsisType.STRING, True)
        connection.viewAdd(view)

    indexes = ['name', 'customerguid']
    for field in indexes:
        context = {'schema': "%s_%s" % (domain, rootobject), 'view': view_name, 'field': field}
        connection.runQuery("CREATE INDEX %(field)s_%(schema)s_%(view)s ON %(schema)s.%(view)s (%(field)s)" % context)
[[/code]]        


##What's Next?
In this section you have learned how you can create OSIS views on Root Objects. The most important topics are the creation of the OSIS view itself and create indexes on the view for optimizing the data retrieval.
In the next section we will cover how you can store, update, and delete objects from an OSIS view.
