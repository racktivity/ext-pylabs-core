# Installing the SampleApp

PyLabs 5 has created a sample PyLabs application (PyApp), called '**sampleapp**'. This is a very basic CRM application, just to show the power of PyLabs.
To install this sample application:

1. Go to the PyLabs root directory: `cd /opt/qbase5/` 
2. Start the Q-Shell: `./qshell` 
3. Find and install the sample application: `i.qp.find('sampleapp').install()` 
4. Make the application available in PyLabs 5: `p.application.install('sampleapp')`

The sample application is now installed on your system. To access the application, open a web browser and go to:

**http://IpAddress/sampleapp**

where '<ip address>' is the IP address of the machine on which you installed the sample application. If you installed it on a Desktop version, you can go to localhost/sampleapp.


## About the Sample Application
The sample application contains documentation about creating your own PyLabs application. To open the documentation, browse to the sample application.
By default, the '*crm*' space is displayed. Switch the space to '*doc*' to get the PyLabs Application documentation.
