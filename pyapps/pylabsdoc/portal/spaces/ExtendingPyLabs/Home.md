#Extending Pylabs

A default Pylabs installation is a powerful framework that has already a huge variety of functions. The architecture of Pylabs is created in such a way that each functionality is an extension on the core framework. 
Each of the functionalities is built as an extension on the core framework. Therefore you can create your own extensions yourself to add extra functionalities. By doing so you can use your extensions in your own [scripts][].

Besides the creation of extra functionality, you can also extend Pylabs with new enumerators, for example for usage in a Pylabs Application.
