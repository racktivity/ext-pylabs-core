# CMD Tools Extension Specifications

The CMD Tools extension must contain one or multiple command files which contain the methods that wraps the command line tools of the application. 
The methods should also include the logic and possible tests that precede the actual command. For example, check that the status of an application is not already 'STARTING' when trying to start the application.

By wrapping the command tools, you gain more control over the commands, for example you can add logging when a command is executed. 

Use the 'cmdtools' namespace as location for these methods. Check the [Q-Namespace][namespace] page for more details on the cmdtools namespace.


## Content of the Specification File

* Import the required modules. Check How to Import PyLabs][importpylabs] and [How to Import Classes from Extensions][importextension].
* Add a Class that inherits from the base class [CMDBApplicationObject][baseclass].
* Add all methods of the class.
* Add PyDocs for *each* method that gives its full explanation, see the *DocString* section in the [Contributing in Style][contribute] page.


## Advantages

* The developer has immediately all modules that he has to use.
* The developer no longer has to take care of the documentation of the methods
* The developer can immediately use the extension in the Q-Shell
