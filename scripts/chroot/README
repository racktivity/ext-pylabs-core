These scripts help you with running pylabs5 in a chroot.

- First set up a chroot using setup.sh
- Then start it with start.sh (start.sh will mount /proc, /dev etc and copy over your hosts file)
- Install pylabs 5 in the chroot with install.sh
- Now you can chroot into your sandbox with "sudo chroot /srv/chroot/sandbox /bin/bash"
- To kill all processes in your chroot, and unmount all mounts in the chroot, run stop.sh
- To restart with a fresh sandbox, use reset.sh
