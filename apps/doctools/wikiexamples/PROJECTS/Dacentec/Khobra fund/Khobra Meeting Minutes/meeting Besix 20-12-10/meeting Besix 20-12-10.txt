h3. Besix feedback on Jeddah

* harsh climate
** summer: 40째-48째C
** winter: 28째-32째C
** very high humidity
** sandstorms: not frequent in that area.
* earthquake zone
** close to the coast: coral rock (less stable)
** 1-2km inland: solid rock (better)
* electricity supply is very unreliable
** high emphasis on backup generators en UPS's required
* high bureaucracy (general for SA)

h3. Besix feedback on building and pricing

* Besix started operations 2 years ago in Saudi Arabia. They work with local contractors as jumpstart.
* concrete in Jeddah area is cheap due to high availability of raw materials
* cool units should be protected from sand (floating roof)
* rule of thumb pricing estimate (building only, no equipment):
** non-office: 5.000m2 x 1.200 eur/m2 = 6.000.000 eur
** offices:    1.000m2 x 1.700 eur/m2 = 1.700.000 eur
** height: add 15%
** total: 8.855.000 eur ($ 12 M)
* more detailed estimate will be supplied asap
* Besix interest?
** project probably too small for them
** Besix will be expensive compared to others
** possibility: local contractor "AL MUHAIDIB" ([http://www.muhaidib.com/]), under supervision of Besix.
