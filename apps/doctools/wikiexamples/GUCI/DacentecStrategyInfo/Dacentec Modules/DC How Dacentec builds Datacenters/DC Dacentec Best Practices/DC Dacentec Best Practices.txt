h2. Best Practice Standards also applied by Dacentec

Along with the specific cloud and green measures, Dacentec will also apply following best practices in each of its Datacenters:

* Building selection process:
** optimal location
** not in flooding area
* Crossing of power grids
* Availability of a lot of fiber
* Fully redundant setup:
** redundant generators
** A and B feeds
** diverse fibre entry: different sides of the building
** redundant UPSs
** redundant cooling
* Fully secured: iris scan, finger print, camera security
* No customers access policy: since the raw material is already inside, there is never a customer that needs to enter the datacenter
