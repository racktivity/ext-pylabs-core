h2. How everyone constructed their Datacenters

Ingredients to a typical datacenter are:

{table}{tr}{td:valign=top|width=500}* Building & Power
** A secure building, fully shielded with no windows and restricted access
** 1 or 2 external high voltage power feeds
** Connection of high voltage feeds to transformers

{table}{tr}{td:valign=top|width=500}* Datacenter supply equipment
** Batteries, called UPS: Uninterruptible power supply, to foresee power in case of of power breakdown by the utility company
** Switch board room to distribute the power
** Diesel generators to have power in case of of power breakdown by the utility company

{table}{tr}{td:valign=top|width=500}* Cooling equiment:
** chillers: to cool down the water for the airco conditioning
** airco units below the raised floor
** cooled air is blown into the datacenter rooms via perforated tiles

{table}{tr}{td:valign=top|width=500}* Colocation rooms:
** Private room (racks all for 1 customer) or shared rooms (multiple customers)
** Datacenter customers hire 1/4 of a rack up to a rack
** Each room typically will include a raised floor: below it are cables and airco units
** Racks are installed in such a way that the servers installed by customers suck in cooled air

{table}{tr}{td:valign=top|width=500}* Cable trays
** Power distribution towards the racks
** Networking distribution towards the racks
** building automation cables: security camera, door security, ...

{table}{tr}{td:valign=top|width=500}* Building Automation equipment
** securtiy cameras
** access security
** equipment status monitoring
{td}{td:valign=top}!dacentec_dc_security.png|width=300!{td}{tr}{table}

{table}{tr}{td:valign=top|width=500}* Networking equipment
** Entry of telcos in the building
** Connections between bandwidth providers and datacenter customers
** Connections between datacenter customers
** All connections are manually installed by cable junctions in the Datacenter Peering Room

This typical datacenter concept is still being applied since it is considered as best of breed, mainly because everyone has been doing it like this for a long time.

The cost of the datacenter construction increases by measures of extra redundancy, more expensive equipment, more expensive subcontractors and building costs.
