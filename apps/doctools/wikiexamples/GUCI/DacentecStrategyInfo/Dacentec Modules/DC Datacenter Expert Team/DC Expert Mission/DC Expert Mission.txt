Dacentec constructs Green Cloud Datacenters with carbon footprints 75% less than major Tier 1 Datacenters.

Compared to the big SAAS players like Google, Facebook and Yahoo, we donâ€™t keep our datacenter design technology to ourselves. We will also help other companies to build greener and more cost effective datacenters.

Dacentec provides raw CPU and TB storage capacity into our datacenters to anyone looking to build a cloud platform: IAAS, SAAS, PAAS.
