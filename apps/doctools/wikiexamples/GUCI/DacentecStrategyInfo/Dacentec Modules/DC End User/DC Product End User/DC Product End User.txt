h3. Cloud Datacenter for Cloud Providers

Dacentec constructed a privately owned datacenters in the US, North Carolina (next to Google in North Carolina on crossing of 2 powergrids). 
In that datacenters we *applied our new Green Unbreakable Cloud concept* and can prove the impact of our solution.

In Dacentec`s US Datacenter facility in Lenoir, NC, Dacentec provides 300PB storage capacity(Petabyte = 1024 Terabyte = 1.048.576 GBytes) and 150.000 CPU cores capacity.

*Customers can buy raw capacity to build their own IAAS cloud offering: Storage, CPU, Networking, Bandwidth.*

Customers can take benefit from our Datacenter Automation that is tightly integrated with the installed Plate Concept.

Each datacenter unit has a *renewed cooling approach*:
* Air circulation mechanism brings in non cooled air from the outside and sends in out again in the atmosphere
* Each rack sucks in air via a ventilator and sends heated air outside
* Only 2 ventilators per rack

*Racks are totally redesigned*, each racks has:
* Own air evacuation system: perforated back wall connects to a ventilator that sucks the cooler through the rack
* Passive power system 48 V: own batteries installed in the bottom that deliver 48V power
* Built in environmental monitoring: temperature, humidity, airflow
* Built in energy monitoring
* Plate servers that are providing the basis for the cloud infrastructure

*Plate servers* that have:
* An open casing, all the components are attached to an iron plate
* An Unbreakable Storage System installed: dispersed storage technology including self healing, spreading the data in such a way that the failure of several plate servers does not affect production
* CPU capacity on board
* On board energy measurement component
* Power delivered at 48V directly over an iron power bar in the back of the rack that touches the inserted plates
