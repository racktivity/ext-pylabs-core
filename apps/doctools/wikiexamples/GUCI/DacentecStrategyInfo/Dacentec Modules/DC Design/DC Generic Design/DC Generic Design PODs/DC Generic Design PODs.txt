h3. Datacenter POD

The Datacenter POD is a fully independent datacenter including 60 racks.

* The POD design is used for both plate racks and for colocation purposes.
* Each POD has 60 racks, a dedicated generator, dedicated cooling, dedicated switchboard, dedicated fire security system.
* Each 5 PODs share a backup generator (N+1 redundancy).
* Optionally, a 2 (N+1) system can be implemented where each POD has redundant components and can still failover to generators of other PODs
* The Switchboard includes the functionality to switch between the external feed (utility companny) and the internal feed (generators)
* Each row in the POD has its own PDU (Power Distribution Unit) that also includes a fuse for each rack

The cooling is a closed loop principle that is designed as follows:
* 2 rows of rack are frontal faced and closed by the sides
* around the rows chilled air is blown in from top roof cooling units
* the chilled air is sucked in by the ventilators of the servers (colo) or plate racks (cloud)
* the hot air raises in the closed corridor in between the rows and is sucked out and send to the chillers to cool down the air

There are 2 types of PODs: Cloud Datacenter PODs & Colocation PODs

The cloud datacenter POD includes:
* 60 Plate Racks
* 5kW per rack, 48V DC
* 300kW per POD
* Conversion of AC-DC inside the rack
* 6KVA UPS per rack, 48V
* Cooling per POD
* 750 kW Generator
* 1600A 480V Switchboard

The Colocation datacenter POD includes:
* 60 Racks per POD
* 5kW per rack, 208V AC
* 300kW per POD
* 550 KVA UPS per POD
* Cooling per POD
* 750 kW Generator
* 1600A 480V Switchboard
* Possible upgrade to 2N+1
