Dacentec builds its Datacenters very modular by use of PODs. A POD is a seperate room holding 60 racks and has its own dedicated supply equipment like generator and cooling.

This modular datacenter design layout provides many benefits:
* Allow a phased build out of the datacenter
* Reduce costs thanks to more simple components and materials required for each POD
* Spreads the risk thanks to full POD independency: dedicated generator and dedicated cooling per POD
* Brings better uptimes thanks to more transparant setup and easier to manage than big complex redundancy equipment used in datacenters
* Simplify future extensions: the decentralised apporach allows to extend the building fast and easy with additional PODs
* Optimized access control: access into the datacenter POD without disruption to other operational PODs
