h3. Green Cloud Datacenter

To prove our Green Cloud Datacenter concept, we have *built our own datacenters, but our purpose is also to build datacenters for others*! 
Dacentec constructed a privately owned datacenter in the US, North Carolina (next to Google in North Carolina on crossing of 2 powergrids). 
In that datacenters we *applied our new Green Unbreakable Cloud concept* and can prove the impact of our solution.

In Dacentec`s US Datacenter facility in Lenoir, NC, Dacentec provides 300PB storage capacity(Petabyte = 1024 Terabyte = 1.048.576 GBytes) and 150.000 CPU cores capacity.

The datacenters are *built out more modular*: small rooms that are foreseen with own cooling, own UPS, etc. that operate fully independent. 
Like this we cannot only spread uptime risk by being more decentralized, but also use more cost effective components and have a better contained control on the environment (temperature, humidity, airflow) in the datacenter.

h3. Optional: Plate Concept

Each datacenter unit has a *renewed cooling approach*:
* Air circulation mechanism brings in non cooled air from the outside and sends in out again in the atmosphere
* Each rack sucks in air via a ventilator and sends heated air outside
* Only 2 ventilators per rack

*Racks are totally redesigned*, each racks has:
* Own air evacuation system: perforated back wall connects to a ventilator that sucks the cooler through the rack
* Passive power system 48 V: own batteries installed in the bottom that deliver 48V power
* Built in environmental monitoring: temperature, humidity, airflow
* Built in energy monitoring
* Plate servers that are providing the basis for the cloud infrastructure

*Plate servers* that have:
* An open casing, all the components are attached to an iron plate
* An Unbreakable Storage System installed: dispersed storage technology including self healing, spreading the data in such a way that the failure of several plate servers does not affect production
* CPU capacity on board
* On board energy measurement component
* Power delivered at 48V directly over an iron power bar in the back of the rack that touches the inserted plates
