h2. Dacentec: Problems we are trying to resolve, situation of the market

Datacenters are historically built out from a real estate perspective: renting out floorspace in a secured and redundant environment including power and bandwidth for production infrastructure. Those datacenters have shortages that generate extra costs and creates inefficiency that impacts uptime. This because these *datacenters* have an old *design where the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is bad*. To power 1000 watts of production servers, most datacenters require another 1500 watts to cool down the datacenter, convert the power via UPSs, etc. totalling 2500 watts\! (a *PUE of 2,5*)

*Datacenters that took action and obtained an optimized the PUE up to 1,8 in average*, by making improvements on the supply side of the datacenter: airco, airflow, containment, ... Best PUE reported so far are around 1,21.

Green *datacenters aim to get to 30%-40% power savings but almost never achieve this*. The result of the optimization is in realty \+-20% of cost savings. That is because datacenters:

* +do not know+ what +workloads+ are running on their servers
* +do not know who is polluting+ their power usage (bad power supplies, overloaded racks, …)
* +do not know who is consuming+ all the +power+ (equipment, …) and cannot charge back for power usage.
* +still lose a lot of power+ via many step conversions
* +do not invest in optimization power at the load side+: only 10% of the resources are used: idle servers that are never powered down, few servers use built-in energy reduction functions (ACPI), ...
* +do not have a control of the physical layer+: temperature and airflow are the most difficult to control parameters in a datacenter\! Racks are never equipped with airflow & temperature sensors, causing hotspots that can only be solved via overcooling

*New datacenter challengers* emerged in the market like: Google, Yahoo, Facebook, ... . 
These new challengers significantly improved the way how dealing with reducing costs through renewed datacenter designs and new ways of dealing with energy usage. 
Google and Apple are the best examples of companies having and still building datacenters that are more efficient in cost and uptime and that brought them in a position that makes it for others impossible to obtain the same cost advantages. 
They report PUEs of 1,21 and are aiming lower.

Today's *top notch commercial datacenters have become too expensive and too complex to manage cost effectively*. Datacenter created complexities in setting up redundancies that have been improving the mean time between failures, but caused an increase of the mean time to repair, resulting in longer downtimes.
