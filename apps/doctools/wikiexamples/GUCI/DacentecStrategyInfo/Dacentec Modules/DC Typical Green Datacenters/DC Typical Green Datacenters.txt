h2. How traditional Datacenters are preparing to become green

With increasing energy prices, environmental objectives to lower carbon footprints and fast growing renewing datacenter players like google, existing and new datacenters are triggered to optimize their Power Efficiency usage (PUE).

Typical measures that datacenters are taking to become a green datacenter:

h3. Optimize the airco system

Datacenters started using any form of hot/cold aisle to further improve cooling efficiency.

Hot/cold aisle (or hot aisle/cold aisle) is a method of cooling servers in data centers in which every aisle between rows of racks is bounded with exclusively hot-air outlets or exclusively cool-air intakes by IT equipment installed in the racks. Air is brought into the cool aisles from underneath (by perforated tiles) and exhausted from the hot aisles overhead. This produces constant air circulation through the racks, provided there are no "holes" through which cool air can leak without encountering hardware.

In a hot/cold aisle configuration, the hot aisles are always at a much higher temperature than the cool aisles. Equipment racks are arranged in parallel rows. Air flows generally upward throughout the center with a constant "breeze" through each row. For optimum design, internal fans that bring air into or exhaust it out of individual units should be disabled or configured to act with, not against, the overall pattern of air flow in the center.

Practice today shows that many datacenters applied the hot and cold aisles but did not install blanking panels to avoid mixing air. This is a result that the building and airco system cannot be easily changed for that purpose. The disadvantage is that still a lot of overcooling needs to be done inside the server rooms, wasting a lot of energy.

And when hot-aisle/cold-aisle is installed with raised-floor cooling, there is still a lot of cold air wasted: You can set up hot aisle/cold aisle, install blanking panels, and seal gaps in the floor, but you probably still waste cold air in places you wouldn't expect.


h3. Work on the efficiency of the UPS (batteries)

A lot of power is lost when converting it from high voltage into low voltage. Datacenters are investing into equipment that deals better with the conversion losses.

Still, servers that always work internally on low voltage power are connected to higher 110V (US) or 220V (EU). This last conversion results in a loss of up to 30% of the energy\!

h3. Buy Green power and lower carbon footprint

Electrical utility companies offer programs where companies can reserve energy out of their pool of green energy, often at a special rate.

If the power used by a datacenter is generated by green energy, it can use a label and look more green and efficient towards its customers.

Unfortunatly, this is a measure that will quickly be unoivered as purely marketing and will not allow to be distinctive from others.
