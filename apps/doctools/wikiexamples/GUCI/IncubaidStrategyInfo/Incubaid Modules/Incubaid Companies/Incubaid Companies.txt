h2. Incubaid Overview

About 5 years ago, Amazon took the lead in the Cloud Computing industry with S3 and EC2. Google (AppEngine) and Salesforce (Force.com) joined in, and soon the ecosystem was being segmented in Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS), Platform as a Service (PAAS) and Software as a Service (SAAS). Cloud Computing is experiencing a growing popularity in all industry segments, with a lot of activity within the top layer. Incubaid has identified a lot of opportunities for innovation in the IAAS layer.

In spite of all the Cloud innovation of the past 3 years, the *IAAS layer still faces a lot of issues and it is not Green at all*:

* +Power consumption is still at unacceptable levels+; in the scope of 3 years, the power cost is 50% of the hardware cost.
* There are +still too many manual processes+; we have still not reached full automation, as promised by the cloud paradigm.
* +Current storage technologies are no longer adequate+ for today's storage requirements (low cost, always online, and unbreakable).
* The levels of +complexity in the data center have not been reduced+; most cloud platforms do nothing more than virtualizing servers.

Incubaid developed the *first Green Cloud data center initiative*. Incubaid is an incubator who creates or helps companies to create technology for the cloud.

Incubaid is built by the data center experts team that has helped building over a dozen large-scale data centers during the past two decades, developed cloud software companies, datacenter software, high end and mid market large scale hosting companies.

From that experience we learned that significant improvements for a cloud solution can only be achieved when the entire cloud ecosystem is looked at: Datacenter, Power Management, Physical infrastructure, Management Platform, User Interfaces.

There are 2 approaches followed by companies today to build clouds.
* The best of breed approach where companies try to mix an match 20+ products to create a cloud. This is a complex and not cost effective approach. These clouds are not well integrated and are not disruptive. Many big vendors try to use their products build for the enterprise world in the cloud world. This does not work well.
* The disruptive build from the ground up approach. Only some players like Google, Amazon, Facebook are making progress but these clouds are not generic and are used for specific use cases.

Over the years we have proven that there is a way to build a cloud that is more reliable and cost effective. To achieve that, incubaid created companies that focus each in one specific domain of the cloud stack. Each company rechallenges the best of breed phylosophy by creating new technology concepts that replace existing technolgies and also solve a lot of the painpoints for cloud.
Our cloud concept is build up from the ground we had to re-invent a lot. We started working on this 15 years ago when no-one was talking about clouds yet. 

The companies that work together with Incubaid on achieving the GUCI goals:

* +A-Server+: Is probably the most advanced cloud technology provider in the world. A-server creates and sells scalable, unbreakable private & public cloud solutions. They sell to ISV's (Independan Software Vendores) and to VAR's who sell into the SMB & Enterprise Market.
* +Dacentec+: Is the expert in building the greenest and most effective cloud datacenters. Dacentec implements a combination of new datacenter construction techniques and completes with Incubaid group innovations to deliver unseen efficiency and reliability, *bringing the* *carbon footprint 75% less than major Datacenters*. Dacentec datacenters are *fully automated and the entire infrastructure can be controlled remotely*, which makes it *ideal for cloud computing and archive storage*. 
* +Amplidata+: Amplidata created *a multi petabyte scalable cloud storage system* that is more reliable and much more energy efficient. The TCO of Amplidata's storage system is at least 75% better than the competition.
* +Racktivity+: Racktivity offers a complete set of hardware and software solutions to measure, monitor and manage the energy consumption of data centers. The Companys integrated software and hardware platform will improve uptime and save energy and reduce the energy cost dramatically. Racktivitys smart Power Distribution Unit (PDU) hardware product, Rack Controller, measures and analyzes energy consumption with extreme accuracy so that the customers can increase uptime and reliability while reducing energy consumption on both supply and load side of the power.
