h2. SmartStyle Office Competitive

* *Best of breed* custom made *combinations*:
** VMware virtualisation installed on hardware
** Citrix Xenserver installed on hardware
** Microsoft HyperV
* *Hardware vendors*, trying to push a solution through more and more add ons and pre-installs:
** Example: HP with its total care solution
** Netapp, Equallogic bringing their product as a basis storage layer for virtualization systems
* *Old school way* of delivering IT by channel partners
** HP, Dell, Fujutsi Siemens server with Microsoft Small Business Server
** Storage RAID server vendors including additional tools to built storage pools, ex Dell, HP, SuperServer
* *Hosting Service Providers* (HSPs)
** Hosting companies core business is still dedicated servers, with or without virtualization; SSO offering virtual servers and virtual desktops at the end user premise in SMB, an important segment for many HSPs, goes in direct competition
** HSPs have been trying to convince SMBs to migrate their office applications to their datacenters with tools with messaging & collaboration bundles including Hosted Exchange, Hosted Sharepoint, Hosted CRM, Terminal Services, Backup, ...; also here SSO competes by allowing partners to set up all the tools private at the end user site or even hosted in a datacenter
** HSPs are now embracing the cloud and rolled out their first offerings, mostly auto provisioning of virtual servers by using online control panels
* *Backup for SMB vendors*
** Both Online and on premise sellers of backup solutions are preparing a cloud to incorporate more office functions than only backup
** Examples:
*** software vendors setting up their own clouds will incorporate step by step more functions of the SME office (Kaseya)
* *Public Clouds*: not as a substitute product for the partner, but they go directly to the SMB
** Google Apps Professional
