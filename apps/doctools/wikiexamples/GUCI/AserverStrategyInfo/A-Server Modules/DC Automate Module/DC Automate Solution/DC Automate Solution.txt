h2. DC Automate solution

We have developed DC Automate which is a cloud software only solution.
DC Automate is based on the framework that is used to build the A-Server public cloud solution Datacenter As A Service (DAAS) and the Aserver private cloud solution called SmartStyle Office (SSO).

The DC automate technology allows you to:
* build the most capable & flexible cloud available
* build the most cost effective cloud available
* Have an unbreakable storage system
* Control of your power utilization
* Give control to your customers
* Improve MTBF & MTBR (mean time between repairs)
* Manage your datacenters

This suite is the result of 15Y of development and many product iterations.

We deliver DC Automate as part of custom projects where everything is possible.
These are large scale strategic projects in which A-server wil partner tightly with the customer.

Guaranteed we can allow our customers to build any kind of cloud solution independant from hypervisor, hardware, network, ....
