h3. DAAS.com Storage Cloud

h4. 100% protection of your data

DAAS.com stores data in a revolutionary way: DAAS.com uses a dispersed storage system that is 10,000 times more reliable than a traditional RAID based storage system. This system is called DAAS.com StorageSpread.

DAAS.com StorageSpread offers storage space accessible via different methods: S3 API, FTP, WebDAV. StorageSpread will disperse all received data over different cloud storage nodes in such a way that several cloud nodes can fail and the data is still safe and available\! The intelligent StorageSpread system is designed fully transparently for customers who will not notice any delay on the storage side. StorageSpread also guards data, by built-in data quality check functions.

h4. Functionality

DAAS.com Storage Cloud works as follows:

# Register online for a DAAS.com account
# Provide your billing details
# Choose the number of virtual disks and TB per disk
# Your order will now be validated by the DAAS.com support team
# You receive an e-mail with access details to the Storage Management Center
# You log in into the Storage Management Center
# You can now see your ordered disks, with available and used capacity and activate S3, FTP and WebDAV accounts

h4. Features:

* 100% Reliability and Availability: StorageSpread does not require lengthy and cumbersome rebuilds that cause data to remain unprotected for multiple days. StorageSpread can lose up to 4 disks without any impact. In case a disk fails, a spare disk will rebuild immediately the storage spread without a load impact on the other disks in the pool.

* Reduces power consumption: traditional RAID systems have a high energy consumption since all disks need to keep spinning. StorageSpread optimized spreading technology lowers the load on each disk, consequently reducing the energy consumption.

* High Scalability: let your storage volume grow step by step, seamlessly, up to 100 TB\!

* Built-in functions that protect against bit errors and bit rot on disk, block replication or multiple data copies

* Retain history of the stored data, making it possible to go back in time to recover from eventual corruption

* Storage Management Center: online web administration that allows: view disks and files, upload/download files, create and manage storage access methods (S3, WebDAV, FTP)


h3. DAAS.com Private Cloud

h4. A full private cloud

DAAS.com allows you to set up and configure infrastructure, with full freedom to define your own instances, operating systems and applications. DAAS.com is designed in such a way that you have all flexibility of dedicated hosting together with the advantages of cloud computing like auto provisioning, scalability and high reliability.

DAAS.com allows customers to upload their own images and pre-package them as an instance. DAAS.com is a private cloud, thus running on dedicated hardware per customer. This means that customers will manage their own capacity and deploy their full custom instances on that infrastucture.

With DAAS.com There is no price per unit, no virtual units, virtual cores or RAM hours: just a price per cloud node per month. A cloud node delivers all you need: CPU, RAM, Networking and Storage.

DAAS.com is much more than virtualisation installed at a server, it is a cloud computing framework in which the virtual servers can be moved around, where storage is designed for 100% availability and where monitoring and backup is fully automated for each private cloud.

Customers can start off with just one cloud node and keep on adding nodes to their cloud environment. Each time a cloud node is added, it will be available as additional capacity in the customers cloud. Billing was never more simple, just the price for a cloud node per month covers all\!

All this means that you get what you payed for: freedom of instance choice, use of own OSs, transparent billing, no sharing of resources and guaranteed private computing & storage capacity\!
