h2. V-app Market Product Description

h3. Vapp-Market delivers an extensive library of software

The Vapp-Market library contains hundreds of different applications spanning all major product categories. It includes both Open Source server and licensed server software.

The "ready to use" concept is saving time in setting it all up, managing updates, but also encourages to evaluate applications more quickly. When you are satisfied you can start using it instantly in production.

Vapp-Market is a virtual machine instance that includes an Operation System along with server applications installed. These server applications are installed using a packaging method.

h3. Vapp-Market uses Qpackages

The Q-Package (virtual applications) system introduces an application packaging system, that has the advantages of a conventional packaging system but not the complexity. Q-Package takes away all the packaging difficulties and is targeted specifically at system administrators, who are not considered developers. When applications have been packaged as a Q-Package, these packaged applications are called "QPackages".

Q-Packages framework is like RPM or Apt-get, but more advanced and not tied to a single distribution or operating system.

A Q-Package is an application that has been packaged for easy installation using the application packaging framework of Q-Shell. Q-Shell is a powerful and easy-to-use cross platform shell. Q-Shell can be installed on Linux, OpenSolaris and Windows, it provides powerful features for system administration and it is the primary user interface to download, install and handle all Q-Packages. Q-Shell can be downloaded from http://www.pylabs.org.
