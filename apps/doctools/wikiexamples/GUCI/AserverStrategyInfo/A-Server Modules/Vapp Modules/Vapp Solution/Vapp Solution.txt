h2. Vapp-Market Solution

Vapp-Market lets you run server applications instantly with full flexibility and privacy like you would have set it up yourself!

Vapp-Market is a marketplace of "ready-to-use" applications already pre-installed into a private virtual machine. This virtual machine will be activated on a private cloud instance in the DAAS.com computing environment located in European and US Green Cloud Datacenters.

Users of Vapp-market will register through vapp-market.com. Here they will be able to browse a library of applications. Launching an application can be done by clicking the "launch in DAAS.com" cloud button. A few minutes later the user receives confirmation that the a Virtual Machine(s) is running with its preferred applications installed.

The user has compared to SAAS business applications full root access to the server. He can also fully customize its applications!

One of the unique features of Vapp-market is that the user does not have to worry about updating its software! He will be using an automated software update framework! Each application will be installed in a virtual container and can be sychronised without having any impact on the surrounding applications and OS.

Vapp-market uses for the software packaging:
* Incubaid`s QPackages for Windows and Linux OSs
* Ubuntu's Advanced Packaging Tool for the Ubuntu OS
