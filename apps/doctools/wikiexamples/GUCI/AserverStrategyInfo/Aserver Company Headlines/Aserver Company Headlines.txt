h1. Company Goal

* Be a technology innovator and global leading Provider of cloud solutions
* Improve painpoints in and around the datacenter
* Rechallenge current best of breed technologies when we see it can be done better and/or cheaper

h2. The problem

It infrastucture and datacenters are not managed efficiently:

* Power is ½ of cost of hardware over 3 years
* Manual processes
* MTBR is bad
* Storage is one of biggest issues to deal with (DR, backup, reliability, …)
* Complexity is huge
* Automation is low

Further:

* IT, both from datacenter and local perspective, is still very much hardware driven
* Customers want infrastructure that is *available, reliable, scalable and performing*, often called `agility`
* today's approach to servicing these is very much dependent on hardware configurations
** availability and reliabilty is fundamentally achieved through hardware redundancy
** scalability and performance are worked around through over-dimensioning IT environments
* This hardware diversity leads to great complexity
** *heavy integration* with high implementation costs
** *"unmanageability"* leads to errors and downtime and as such high operational costs
** rigidness of environment demands for *continuous investments* and "desinvestments"

h2. The solution

* We have developed a fully integrated cloud platform environment, offering
** High Availability, through 
*** granular node-based architecture
*** built-in snapshotting and recovery options
*** intelligent hardware monitoring/power management (Racktivity)
** Data Reliability, through Unbreakable Storage (Amplidata)
** Scalability and performance through Plug&Play of resource nodes (cpu, ram, storage)

* Integration of all elements has lead to a great simplification of the infrastructure, and offers a number of additional benefits
** manageability, through a central user interface (for your entire IT environment, servers and desktops where required)
** Fast time to implementation
** Change in the hardware paradigm of "bigger, faster, stronger" leading to lower TCOs
** No need to over-dimension environments, i.e. invest only in what you really need today

* The solution can be set in production in different ways
** Market-ready Public Cloud: DataCenter As A Service (DAAS)
** On-premise and hosted Private Clouds: SmartStyle Office (SSO)
** Tailored cloud solution based on A-Server cloud platform: DC Automate

h2. Target Market

Any company willing with a need to obtain agility by using a cloud-based business strategy:
* We have a cloud platform that can serve an enterprise market directly, through custom delivery of cloud solutions, DC Automate
* We can serve ISVs and SAAS vendors through our public cloud, DAAS.
* We offer the SME market the perspective of a private cloud via SSO.

h2. Competition

h3. Channel (details see [INC:Product info SSO])

* Best of breed custom made combinations
* Hardware vendors, trying to push a solution through more and more add ons and pre-installs:
* Old school way of delivering IT by channel partners
* Hosting Service Providers (HSPs)
* Backup for SMB vendors
* Public Clouds: not as a substitute product for the partner, but they go directly to the SMB

h3. Direct

* Best of breed custom combinations
* Amazon Webservices to developers
* Hosting Service Providers

h2. What we are not

* a professional services firm
* a system integrator
* an ISV
