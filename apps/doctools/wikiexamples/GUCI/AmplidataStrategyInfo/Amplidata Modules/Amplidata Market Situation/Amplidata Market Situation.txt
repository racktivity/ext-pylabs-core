h2. Amplidata: Problems we are trying to resolve, situation of the market
 
A key challenge for storage-intensive online application providers is how to build 100TB+ storage infrastructures that meet the capacity and availability requirements of an always-online service. Enterprise storage solutions are too expensive, so most service providers choose to build a system in-house using open source software components and cheap hardware. Whether the solution is based on a cloud storage system, a clustered file system, IP san or block relocation technology, the data is typically stored on hard disks which are protected against failures using RAID.
 
Disk capacities have increased tremendously (average disk size is 1 TB) and because of the always available requirements for data, RAID is no longer a viable technology:
 
* The Reliability and Availability score of RAID drops as disk capacity increases because of
lengthy and cumbersome rebuilds that cause data to remain unprotected for multiple days
* RAID is power-hungry as all disks need to keep spinning: energy consumption is unacceptable according to current standards
* As RAID is statically configured, managing and scaling RAID systems is cumbersome and resource intensive
* RAID does not protect against bit errors or bit rot on disk, block replication or multiple data copies
* RAID systems do not retain history of the stored data, making it impossible to go back in time to recover from eventual corruption
 
Amplidata replaces RAID at the bottom layer of the storage stack and provides better levels of availability at a fraction of the cost. The Amplidata technology can be integrated as one or multiple high-available disks in your application or legacy storage environment where currently raid volumes would be used as storage targets. Using the Amplidata disk technology will make a storage environment 10,000 times more reliable while consuming less raw disk capacity and power.
