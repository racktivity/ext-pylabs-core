h2. Amplidata Solution

Amplidata delivers a RAID placement disk storage system that is more reliable, more energy efficient and more scalable:

*Unbreakable - AmpliStor is 10,000 times more reliable*
Amplidata BitSpread stores data 10,000 times more reliably than RAID and replication based solutions. BitDynamics monitors the storage system and proactively verifies and heals stored data.

*Green - AmpliStor consumes 10 times less power*
The AmpliStor solution reduces overall power cost by a factor 10. The BitSpread encoder requires 2-3 times less raw disk capacity to store data while the Amplidata appliance with power management consumes up to 5 times less power than typical storage servers.

*Scalable - ZetaByte ready*
Scale AmpliStor by simply adding storage nodes. No reconfiguration is required as the BitDynamics technology automatically includes added capacity in the storage pool. Amplidata scales beyond petabytes.
