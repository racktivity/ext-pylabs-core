# MemFS - A Simple Python Fuse Example
# An example of a real file system, implemented from TemplateFS.
# A simple memory-mapped file system. (The contents are stored in Python data
# structures, and lost when the system is unmounted).
#
# Usage:
#     memfs.py MOUNTPOINT
# To unmount:
#     fusermount -u MOUNTPOINT
#
# Use `tail -f LOG` to read the log in real-time (as it is written).
# Also, mount with `./memfs.py MOUNTPOINT -d` to have FUSE print out its own
# debugging messages (which are in some cases more, and some cases less useful
# than mine).

# First, we define a class deriving from fuse.Stat. This object is used to
# describe a file in our virtual file system.
# This class is rather large, but the concept is really simple (there's just a
# lot of code here to make construction really easy).
# All you have to do is present an object with the following fields, all ints:
#   st_mode:
#       Should be stat.S_IFREG or S_IFDIR OR'd with a normal Unix permission
#       flag, such as 644.
#   st_ino, st_dev:
#       0. Ignored, but required.
#   st_nlink:
#       Number of hard links to this file. For files, usually 1. For
#       directories, usually 2 + number of immediate subdirs (one for parent,
#       one for self, one for each child).
#   st_uid, st_gid:
#       uid/gid of file owner.
#   st_size:
#       File size in bytes.
#   st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime:
#       File access times, in seconds since the epoch, UTC time. Last access
#       time, modification time, stat change time, respectively.

    A Fuse filesystem object. Implements methods which are called by the Fuse
    system as a result of the operating system requesting filesystem
    operations on places where this file system is mounted.

    Unless otherwise documented, all of these methods return an int.
    This should be 0 on success, or the NEGATIVE of an errno value on failure.
    For example, to report "no such file or directory", methods return
    -errno.ENOENT. See the errno manpage for a list of errno values. (Though
    note that Python's errno is slightly different; see help(errno)).
    Methods should return errno.EOPNOTSUPP (operation not supported) if they
    are deliberately not supported, or errno.ENOSYS (function not implemented)
    if they have not yet been implemented.

    Unless otherwise documented, all paths should begin with a '/' and be
    "absolute paths", where "absolute" means relative to the root of the
    mounted filesystem. There are no references to files outside the

    # Methods in this section are operations for opening files and working on
    # open files.
    # "open" and "create" are methods for opening files. They *may* return an
    # arbitrary Python object (not None or int), which is used as a file
    # handle by the methods for working on files.
    # All the other methods (fgetattr, release, read, write, fsync, flush,
    # ftruncate and lock) are methods for working on files. They should all be
    # prepared to accept an optional file-handle argument, which is whatever
    # object "open" or "create" returned.
